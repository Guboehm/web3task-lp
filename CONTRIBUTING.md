## <a name="first-code-contribution"></a> Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to this project? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `dog` issues:

- `good first issue` - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- `dog` - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/w3b3d3v/web3task-lp/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.
   You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.

2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add.
   Discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.

3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository.

4. In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
     ```

5. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.

6. Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).

7. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our [commit message conventions](#commit).
   Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

     ```shell
     git commit --all
     ```
    Note: the optional commit `--all` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

8.  Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

9.  In GitHub, send a pull request to `web3task-lp:dev`.
    
## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* All public API methods **must be documented**.
